## Extra TextMate Themes

This is a [Textmate][textmate] bundle containing only third-party [TextMate Themes][textmate-themes].  This bundle will
not ship any grammars, commands or any other TextMate feature...only themes.

The purpose for this bundle is to provide a central bundle for unofficial TextMate themes to be easily packaged and
installed.  Below is the list of currently available themes:

* **Atom Dark** - This is a port of the [Atom.io][atom-io] [Atom Dark][atom-dark-syntax] theme

### Installation

Installation is as simple as cloning the repository either into `~/Library/Application Support/Avian/Bundles` or
cloning it elsewhere and symlinking it within the aforementioned location.

### Contributing

To keep things on the up and up, I'd rather only have Themes in this repository be original works.  (This does not mean
you necessarily had the original design but you did the work to create the theme or port the theme frome elsewhere.)  I
realize that there are abandoned themes out there which are really great and would make a great addition to this
project.  In cases like these, please attempt to contact the original owner and request they submit the theme
themselves or release the theme to your care, or the care of this project.  Just make sure the author/contact
information in the theme metadata is correct.

As for the process for submission, fork this repository and submit a pull request.  It's as simple as that.
